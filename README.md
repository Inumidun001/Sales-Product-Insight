# üíº Sales & Product Insights with SQL

This project showcases a set of SQL queries written to analyze and extract business insights from a mock sales dataset (`Sales_Transactions_2024`) and its related product catalog (`Products`).

It demonstrates how structured SQL queries can be used to perform revenue analysis, profit estimation, inventory checks, and combine multiple tables through JOINs.
